* dns.piholePTR
Controls whether and how FTL will reply with for address for which a local interface exists. Changing this setting causes FTL to restart.
NONE

Pi-hole will not respond automatically on PTR requests to local interface addresses. Ensure pi.hole and/or hostname records exist elsewhere.
HOSTNAME

Serve the machine's hostname. The hostname is queried from the kernel through uname(2)->nodename. If the machine has multiple network interfaces, it can also have multiple nodenames. In this case, it is unspecified and up to the kernel which one will be returned. On Linux, the returned string is what has been set using sethostname(2) which is typically what has been set in /etc/hostname.
HOSTNAMEFQDN

Serve the machine's hostname (see limitations above) as fully qualified domain by adding the local domain. If no local domain has been defined (config option dns.domain), FTL tries to query the domain name from the kernel using getdomainname(2). If this fails, FTL appends ".no_fqdn_available" to the hostname.
# PI.HOLE (default)

Respond with "pi.hole".
